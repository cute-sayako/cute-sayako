I'm Sayako from the Department of Abstract Nonsense of Zelenskgradskiy Politekhnicheskiy Institute (don't try to find it; it's fictional...).

Discord: Fourier-Deligne Transgirl#3264 (I’m the trans girl🏳️‍⚧️👩‍🏫 used in Laumon’s proof✍️🏋️‍♀️➡️🌾  of the Riemann hypothesis0️⃣🪅 for finite fields❌∞!)

I like derived geometry and arithmetic geometry. I've enjoyed (pro)\'etale cohomology, abelian class field theory, perverse sheaves, among others.
I'm currently reading about the FLT, the Lurie trilogy, and the Langlands program and its derivatives.
